Installation instructions
-------------------------

1. Unzip the AAMAS2024.zip file in a directory of your choice
2. Install the Julia programming language for your operating system following the instructions at https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/
3. Run Julia
4. From Julia, install the JUMP package following the instructions at https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/
4. From Julia, install the HiGHS package by typing the following commands

import Pkg
Pkg.add("HiGHS")

5. From Julia, install the MultiObjectiveAlgorithms package by typing the following commands

import Pkg
Pkg.add("MultiObjectiveAlgorithms")

6. From Julia, install the Plots package by typing the following commands

import Pkg
Pkg.add("Plots")


Organisation of the distribution
--------------------------------
After unzipping the AAMAS2024.zip file, you will obtain the following contents within AAMAS2024:

- The "PB_analyser.jl" file: it is a Julia file that reads a file with participatory budgeting data, computes the Pareto Front, and the Nash and Kalai-Smordinsky solutions.
- The "data" directory contains all the datasets employed in the paper for both Barcelona and Poland. Each data file contains the pre-computed values for citizen satisfaction and value alignment for each proposal.
- The "results" directory contains the output produced when running PB_analyser.jl for each dataset in the data directory
- The "plots" directory contains the Pareto front plots for each one of the datasets in the data directory


How to run and plot an example
------------------------------
First, make sure that you can run Julia in your computer.
If so, cd into the AAMAS2024 directory that results from unzipping the AAMAS2024.zip file:

yourpath> cd AAMAS2024

From there, simply run julia as follows:

yourpath> julia PB_analyser.jl dataset_name

where dataset_name must be one of the following ones:

Bemowo
Bialoleka
Bielany
CiutatVella
Eixample
Gracia
HortaGuinardo
LesCorts
Mokotow
NouBarris
Ochota
Praga-Polnoc
Praga-Poludnie
Rembertow
SantAndreu
SarriaSantGervasi
SantMarti
SantsMontjuic
Srodmiescie
Targowek
Ursus
Ursynow
Warszawa
Wawer
Wilanow
Wlochy
Wesola
Wola
Zoliborz

If everything goes well, PB_analyser.jl will create a log file in the results directory containing:
- the points in the Pareto Front
- the Nash product solution
- the Kalai-Smordinsky solution
- the proposals that are part of each solution in the Pareto front

For instance, the results file for the Bemowo dataset would be a file called PB_Bemowo.txt within the results directory.

Furhtermore, PB_analyser.jl also creates a PNG picture of the Pareto front within the plots directory. For instance, the plot file for the Bemowo dataset would be a file called PB_Bemowo.png within the plots directory.
